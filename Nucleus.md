## Nucleus

![Nucleus](images/nucleus.png)

Nucleus is a 3D vector synthesizer that can be used
for generating complex control voltages or audio signals.
Nucleus is a simulation based on a few imaginary physical laws.
In the simulation, there are five particles moving in 3D space.
The particles are labeled A, B, C, D, E.
The particles interact with each other via forces, as discussed below.

The input to Nucleus is the 3D position of particle A expressed as
three voltages AX, AY, AZ.

The output of Nucleus is the 3D position of all the other particles B, C, D, E.

### Control groups

Let us call the combination of a large parameter knob, a small attenuverter knob,
and a CV input port a *control group*. Nucleus includes the following control groups:

* **SPEED**:
* **DECAY**:
* **MAGNET**:
* **IN**:
* **OUT**:
