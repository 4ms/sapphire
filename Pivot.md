## Pivot

![Pivot](images/pivot.png)

Pivot receives an input 3D vector, twists it by a CV-adjustable angle, and outputs the result.
This module, in combination with [Frolic](Frolic.md), [Glee](Glee.md), and [Rotini](Rotini.md),
can create novel chaotic control signals for modulating generative movement in your patches.
