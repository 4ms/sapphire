## Galaxy

Sapphire Galaxy is an adaptation of Airwindows Galactic by [Chris Johnson](https://github.com/airwindows/airwindows).

Galactic is also available for VCV Rack in the consolidated
[Airwindows Suite](https://library.vcvrack.com/Airwin2Rack/Airwin2Rack)
along with many other filters and effects, all combined into one module.

Sapphire Galaxy and Airwindows Galactic are verified to produce identical output when given identical input and settings.

Galaxy is intended as a stepping stone toward future Sapphire projects that are still in the brainstorming stage.
