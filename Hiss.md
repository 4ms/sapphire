## Hiss

![Hiss](images/hiss.png)

Sapphire Hiss is a vector noise generator. Unlike most noise generators,
the output of Hiss is a stream of N-dimensional vectors that point
in any direction in the N-dimensional space with equal likelihood.

A naively constructed vector generator will produce vectors that
too often point along diagonals of the coordinate axes.

Each component of the generated vectors (that is, the voltage of
each channel of the polyphonic output) follows a normal distribution
with a mean value of 0&nbsp;V and a standard deviation of +3&nbsp;V.
