## Rotini

![Rotini](images/rotini.png)

Rotini is a utility module that calculates the 3D vector cross product
of two input 3D vectors. Vectors are represented by polyphonic cables with 3 channels.
If fewer than 3 channels exist, the values of the missing channels are considered to be 0&nbsp;V.

Rotini can combine the outputs of one [Frolic](Frolic.md) or [Glee](Glee.md) with another Frolic or Glee, to produce a more complex 3D vector signal. The signal can be used to drive movement in a generative patch.

My hope is that with combinations of Frolic and Glee fed through Rotini, modular artists
will have an unlimited toolbox of complex chaotic oscillators.
