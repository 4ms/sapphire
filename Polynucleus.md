## Polynucleus

![Polynucleus](images/polynucleus.png)

Polynucleus is an alternative version of [Nucleus](Nucleus.md),
only with individual 3-channel polyphonic ports for input and output,
rather than triplets of monophonic ports.

Polynucleus is intended to be more convenient for workflows
oriented toward vectors and matrices.
